- Should we record our track each day on Garmin/Strava, just note waypoints, or forget it all and just hike?
    - My penchant for record-keeping makes me want to have GPX of every day, but my Buddha nature says to leave it alone and just move, perhaps keeping a journal of where we stop and what we see. I'm also aware that even with battery banks, it might become a challenge to keep phones and watches charged unless we leave them off a fair bit. But I admit I don't know which way to lean here. I mean, of course we're going to take pictures, so why not other records, right?
