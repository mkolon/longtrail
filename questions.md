- Should we record our track each day on Garmin/Strava, just note waypoints, or forget it all and just hike?
    - My penchant for record-keeping makes me want to have GPX of every day, but my Buddhist nature says to leave it alone and just move, perhaps keeping a journal of where we stop and what we see. I'm also aware that even with battery banks, it might become a challenge to keep phones and watches charged unless we leave them off a fair bit.
